Release 0.1 (???)
=================

Initial release. Please note that as this is a pre-v1 release, API backwards
compatibility is not yet guaranteed. I'm *mostly* happy with the API but for
some subtle aspects of the :class:`ScreenArray` class. Hence if anything's
going to change it's probably going to be there. Feedback welcome!

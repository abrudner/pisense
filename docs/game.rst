Maze Game
=========

Here's a more complex project for the Sense HAT that involves building a full
maze solving game. Initially this will be controlled with the joystick (because
it's easier for debugging), but at the endd we'll switch to use the IMU to roll
the ball through the maze.

.. Software is all about "transformations"

.. A game can be seen as a transformation of a stream of inputs to a stream of
   outputs
